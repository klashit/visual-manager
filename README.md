OOP PHP content manager system full wysiwyg

I created this cms to reset the learning curve for managing the contents of a website by a content manager.
with this innovative cms management of the site after authentication access will have the same vision of a normal user, but you can edit any element on the page with the use of the right mouse button.
This project is designed for PHP developer with experience who want to devote much attention to the design of the UI and then simply replace elements on the page with the corresponding classes.

good work / alessandro verna
